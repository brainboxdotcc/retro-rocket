Welcome to Retro Rocket!

Retro Rocket is a modern operating system inspired by the look and feel of classic home computers.
It combines a clean, lightweight design with the ability to explore and run programs in BASIC - just like the 1980s, but without the need for vintage hardware.

### What Retro Rocket is
- A **self-contained OS** you can boot from CD or install to a hard disk.
- A **retro-inspired environment**: simple, fast, and fun to explore.
- A way to **learn and play with BASIC programs** - run built-in demos, type in your own code, or download new ones.
- A platform that is **retro in spirit, not in hardware**: it targets modern 64-bit PCs, so you don’t need old kit.

### What you can do with it
- Boot into Retro Rocket on almost any PC (or inside a virtual machine).
- Use the **command shell** to explore files and launch programs.
- Write, edit, and run BASIC programs - no prior experience needed.
- Play with **sound and graphics demos** to see what the system can do.
- Use the **1 GB scratch RAM disk** (in LiveCD mode) to save and experiment without touching your hard disk.

### What Retro Rocket is not
- It is not Linux, Windows, or a clone of another operating system.
- It is not intended to run old DOS or Windows programs.
- It is not designed for very old PCs with IDE drives or less than 4 GB of memory.

### Who this guide is for
This guide is written for **non-programmers**:
- Curious users who want to try Retro Rocket and explore its features.
- People new to BASIC who want to load and run programs.
- Anyone using the LiveCD who just wants to “poke around” without worrying about breaking their PC.
