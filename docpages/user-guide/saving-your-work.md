\page saving-your-work Saving Your Work

Retro Rocket gives you places to store your own programs, experiments, and files.
Where you save depends on whether you are running from the LiveCD or from an installed system.

---

### LiveCD mode
When running from the LiveCD, the main system files are read-only.
To give you a place to work, Retro Rocket automatically creates a **RAM disk** at `/ramdisk`.

- The RAM disk is about **1 GB** in size.
- You can save BASIC programs, text files, or other data here.
- Anything stored in the RAM disk will be lost when the machine is rebooted or powered off.

This makes `/ramdisk` a **scratch area**: safe to play with, without touching your hard disk.

---

### Installed system
When Retro Rocket is installed to a hard disk or SSD:

- You can save files **anywhere** you like (for example in `/programs` for your own BASIC programs).
- The RAM disk `/ramdisk` is still available if you want temporary space.

### Notes
- If you want to keep your work between reboots on a LiveCD, copy your files to another machine over the network before shutting down.
- On an installed system, your changes are permanent and stored on the hard disk automatically.
