\page system-requirements Retro Rocket System Requirements

Retro Rocket is *retro in philosophy, not in hardware*. It’s designed to feel like a classic 1980s computer, but it runs on **modern enough PCs** so you don’t have to fight with obscure legacy quirks.
We draw the line at **2012-era hardware**: if your machine is newer than that, you’re in safe territory.

### Minimum

* **CPU:** 64-bit processor from 2012 or later (e.g. AMD FX-4300, Intel Core i5-3570)
* **Memory:** 4 GB RAM
* **Boot Device:** CD-ROM/DVD-ROM or UEFI USB stick
* **Storage:** 32 GB SATA or NVMe hard drive/SSD (Retro Rocket itself fits in <1 GB, but smaller disks are impractical)
* **Graphics:** Built-in/onboard graphics (Intel or AMD) are fine - no special card required
* **Input:** PS/2 or USB keyboard (mouse optional)

### Recommended

* **Memory:** 8 GB RAM or more
* **Boot Device:** CD-ROM/DVD-ROM or UEFI USB stick
* **Storage:** 120 GB+ SSD
* **Graphics:** Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics or newer, or any discrete GPU
* **Network:** Ethernet adapter (Intel e1000, Realtek 8139, Intel 82541PI) for downloads and updates
* **Sound:** Built-in PC audio (HD Audio or AC’97) for music and sound output

@note IDE/PATA drives and very old BIOS-only PCs are not supported. Anything older than 2012 may still boot, but is outside the target. Retro Rocket doesn’t aim to support vintage hardware - it’s about the *retro experience* on practical modern machines.
