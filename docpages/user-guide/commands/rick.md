## rick

If you thought Retro Rocket was all serious and retro-serious BASIC, think again.
Type `rick` at the shell and brace yourself for a pixel-art performance you didn’t ask for but secretly wanted.

### What happens
- A glorious blocky rendition of Rick Astley appears.
- A chiptune-style tracker version of *that* song begins.
- You’ve officially been rickrolled by your operating system.

### How to escape
Press any key when you’ve had enough (if that’s even possible).
Until then, you’re never gonna give it up, never gonna let it down…

### Example
```
rick
```

### Notes
- Works best with speakers turned up to 11.
- Side effects may include involuntary dancing and confused pets.
- You cannot un-see the pixel art. It lives in your mind forever.
