\page RND RND Function

```basic
RND(min, max)
```

Returns a **pseudo-random integer** between `min` and `max` (inclusive).
Both parameters must be integers, and the first must be less than or equal to the second.

The generator uses the **Mersenne Twister (mt19937)** algorithm, seeded from entropy provided by the operating system kernel.

### Examples

```basic
REM Toss a coin (1 or 2)
PRINT RND(1, 2)
```

```basic
REM Roll a six-sided die
PRINT RND(1, 6)
```

```basic
REM Pick a random number between 50 and 5000
PRINT RND(50, 5000)
```

```basic
REM Generate 5 random values between 100 and 200
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    PRINT RND(100, 200)
NEXT
```

### Notes

* The result is an **integer** within the inclusive range `[min, max]`.
* If `min > max`, behaviour is undefined.
* Suitable for general randomness in games, simulations, and sampling.
* **Not cryptographically secure** - although the kernel provides an unpredictable seed, the Mersenne Twister itself is deterministic and predictable if state is known.
* **Retro Rocket BASIC difference:** BBC BASIC used a 33-bit LFSR (linear feedback shift register). Retro Rocket uses a modern PRNG (Mersenne Twister).
