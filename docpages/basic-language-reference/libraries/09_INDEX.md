\page libraries Libraries

System libraries are collections of procedures and functions that can be included in any BASIC program by means of the \ref LIBRARY statement.

Each library groups related functionality into a common set, allowing programs to extend their capabilities without redefining standard routines.

To view details of each library, see its dedicated page in the navigation.
