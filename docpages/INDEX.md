Retro Rocket is a modern hobbyist operating system built in the spirit of the 1980s micros; approachable, transparent, and designed for learning.

It boots on real x86-64 hardware, has its own BASIC dialect for programming and shell work, and exposes the nuts and bolts of how an OS really runs:
memory management, filesystems, multitasking, device drivers and more.

Unlike diving into C kernels or dense textbooks, Retro Rocket lets you explore these concepts in a hands-on way through BASIC and clear documentation, making low-level development feel fun and accessible without needing to be a systems programmer first.
