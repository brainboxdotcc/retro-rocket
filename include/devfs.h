 * @brief Device filesystem interface for Retro Rocket.
 *
 * The Device Filesystem (devfs) is a virtual filesystem that exposes
 * read-only text-based device nodes to userland (e.g. BASIC programs)
 * under the `/devices` path.
 *
 * Each registered device node appears as a file in `/devices` and is backed
 * by a pair of callbacks:
 *  - An update callback, invoked periodically, to refresh the file's metadata
 *    (e.g., size or flags) before it is read.
 *  - A read callback, invoked when userland code reads from the device file,
 *    to copy data into the provided buffer.
 *
 * Only text devices are currently supported. Write operations are not supported.
