# Retro Rocket Network Configuration
# ----------------------------------
#
# This file is read by the network system once a network interface card has
# been initialised.
#
# The loopback interface (127.0.0.1) is always available and does not need
# to be configured here.
#
# At present only a single physical network card is supported. The first
# kernel module that successfully initialises a NIC takes precedence.

# Hostname of the machine
hostname retrorocket

# IPv4 address of the machine in dotted notation, or the literal value 'dhcp'
ip dhcp

# One or more IPv4 DNS server addresses, comma-separated, or 'dhcp'
dns dhcp

# Default gateway IPv4 address in dotted notation, or 'dhcp'
gateway dhcp

# IPv4 network mask in dotted notation, or 'dhcp'
netmask dhcp
